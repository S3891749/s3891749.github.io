	<h3>Description</h3>
	I had the opportunity to meet with two guest lecturers last week, who were invited to transmit advanced knowledge, primarily about computational science and some aspects of information, primarily about how computing works through particle-based information, and to assist me in becoming acquainted with AI technology. On the other hand, on the next day of class, another guest speaker came to my class and shared knowledge regarding hardware and software engineering, such as RAM and CPU, as well as some other significant goods found in a typical computer. I will use my thoughts from the classes to define what I have learned.
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
	When I tackle the material on how computers work in their most fundamental form, it is quite fascinating. Guest lecturers provide a fresh perspective to class, with a different educative way than our regular lecturer, which sparks an unusual interest in the content presented. In addition, I have the opportunity to collaborate with my classmates Khang and Khoa, as we are working on the same research subject. That was a fantastic experience because they were both really nice and responsible for the task.
	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
When I was a kid, I used to hang out with my pals on the internet center, and at the time, I had no idea how someone could make a computer with so many features and little components. But, up until now, I have assumed that the computer follows a precise cycle that includes a variety of other types of code. Approaching this knowledge will be extremely beneficial to me once I complete this course and graduate from high school; it will enable me to readily comprehend a variety of different bits of information that are related to my studies.
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In short, it excites me and I am grateful when I have the opportunity to confront this knowledge; it used to be a struggle for me in the past to understand the mechanism of action, but now that I have a clear understanding of how the computer works throughout the class, I am confident that this knowledge will assist me in achieving my goal in the future.
