After the entire course, I decided to push myself with various methods and some tips which I gained from the lecturer throughout this Unistart course, most of them was about using school’s tools and device to help the student solve hard assignments which we may have in the future study in RMIT. In specific, avail the library is the best way to get knowledge and relevant information in the process of assignments, spending about an hour after class at the library is one of the easiest ways to help us consolidate the old knowledge and brainstorm about how somethings’ works. Besides, the librarian is also a good idea to check your assignment before submitting it into Canvas. Throughout the course process, I also learn about how to manage my study through my classmate’s experiences, meanings, after doing research and some group discussion as well as taking a few conversations with my classmates, I point out many other ways to prove my English skills and so on. Specifically, I learned from my classmates to spend more time reading more articles and relevant sources related to my upcoming programs mostly in English to help me prove both skills. Moreover, I also need to provide and create a biography from now to ready for a path wayfinding my teammates in the colleague by using all sources which were given by the lecturer in my entire course. On the other hand, I also received recommendations from a lecturer about a variety of Clubs in RMIT related to my study programs and also help me to enhance my soft skills which can help me a lot in the future especially after I graduated from university. In short, I have managed my timetable ready to be flexible with any schedule in the upcoming program and prepared everything before I put my first step to university. Specifically, except for the time in class, I spend most of my time remaining researching many other relevant documentaries about Science and technology, besides, I realize that I can access the old course in Canvas even I have passed it, I will probably use this method to practice to avoid misunderstanding from the knowledge and utilize radically school service and tools to support me in my pathway of study.
